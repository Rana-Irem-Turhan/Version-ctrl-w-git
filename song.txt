Oh, it hurts the most 'cause I don't know the cause  Maybe I shouldn't have cried when you left and told me not to wait Oh it kills the most to say that I still care
Now I'm left tryna rewind the times you held and kissed me there  I wonder if you're thinkin', Is she alright all alone?  I wonder if you tried to call but couldn't find your phone  Have I ever crossed your thoughts because your name's all over mine? A moment in time, don't watch me cry
